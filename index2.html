    <h1>Here are some things to know about the animals</h1>
    <h2>Star-nosed mole</h2>

    <p>Star-nosed moles are actually great swimmers because of their front claws,
         and they were the first mammal that was proven to be able to smell underwater. They aren’t a very uncommon species, just rarely seen. </p>
    <h2>Aye-Aye</h2>

    <p>The aye-aye is the only primate who uses echolocation––the process of locating something by producing sounds and then listening to the sounds reflected back. 
        Other animals you may be familiar with that use echolocation are bats and whales.</p>
    <h2>Leafy Sea Dragon</h2>

    <p>The leafy seadragon looks like, well, a leaf. Found swimming off the coast of Australia, this fish looks like a floating plant, serving as a pretty neat camouflage from predators. </p>
